        <h1>Species Information</h1>
        <img src="img/speciesInfo.png">
        <p>Therapets are therapy companions that anyone can adopt! They are super easy to care for, because they don't eat anything and they don't need cleaning up after too much. Instead of food, they get their sustenance from the positive emotions of those around them. The happier the environment, the healthier the Therapet!</p>
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Therapets vary widely in terms of appearance, but a few things are common across the species. They average 2 feet tall when fully grown, and about 7lbs. Differences in traits can change this; for example, a Therapet with extremely floofy fur may weigh a bit more. They always have two nostrils and a smooth mouth with no teeth, only a pinkish-colored tongue. Their front legs are cubbier than their hind legs, and their front paws have 3 toes, while their hind legs have 1 toe each.</p>
        <h2>Magic Sprinkle Dust</h2>
        <img src="img/magicSprinkleDust.png">
        <p>Therapets do not shed their fur, they only shed magic dust. When they're full to the brim with magic and can't take in any more, they start to give off what's called 'magic sprinkles', 'sprinkle dust', or 'magic dust'. This strange substance comes in the form of very tiny, colorful shapes that's almost like dandruff. Instead of being gross though, this magical dust makes anyone who comes into physical contact with it feel happy! The effect is very mild, just enough to cheer you up!</p>
        <p>The most common shape is little stars, but they can be almost any shape. The color of the dust varies among Therapets, and has a bit to do with that individual's coloring. The dust does not need to be cleaned up once shed; they don't shed enough for it to pile up, and it disperses back into the natural magic of the world on its own. In order to feel the mild cheering effects of it, it must be absorbed through the skin.</p>
        <h2>Nutrition</h2>
        <p>Therapets don't eat real food, they feed on positive emotions. They don't 'suck' these feelings from you, they just benefit from it! These emotions fuel their inner magical force, which is what keeps them alive and healthy. They can feed off of the emotions of anyone, not just their owner!</p>
        <p>If a Therapet is in a negative environment for too long, their magic will start to deplete. Their fur/skin will turn dull, then eventually grey. They will become sluggish and droopy looking, and in extreme circumstances, will die. When they die, they 'poof' into a little pile of grey dust. Unlike the magic dust they give off, this dust must be swept up by someone, as it will not be absorbed back into the world's magic (since there's no magic in it).</p>
        <p>Real food doesn't harm them in any way, though it doesn't benefit them either. They can eat any food with no ill effects, and they do so sometimes, if they like the taste of it. They are especially fond of sweet things like candy, cake, and some fruits.</p>
        <h2>Care and Handling</h2>
        <p>Therapets are pets and companions, they need an owner to take care of them. This can be any kind of sentient creature that has the means to do so. Therapets need grooming as well as a positive environment, and some can get quite active. They are curious, outgoing, friendly creatures, but they will quickly turn nervous and flee if they sense any kind of hostile emotions. While they'll always be skittish around strangers' negative emotions, you can lessen their reaction to your own through trust training and building a bond with them.</p>
        <p>The fluffier a Therapet is, the more grooming is necessary for its continued health. Their fur can trap magic dust, and if too much builds up they become stiff, even to the point of being unable to move! Think static electricity with the effect of paralyzing them. too much magic isn't good for anyone! Fluffy Therapets also need to be kept cool when in a warm environment to prevent overheating.</p>
        <p>For Therapets with thin coats or no fur, their magic dust comes off easy but they might get dry skin, or become cold. Dry skin can increase the amount of dust coming off of them, and they might need to keep some of that magic. This can be remedied by giving them a warm bath with special soap to moisturize their skin. Cold Therapets can be given free access to warm blankets, or even wear little sweaters, they usually like them! When it gets warm they might like to take them off sometimes though, and will do so themselves if you don't fast enough.</p>
        <h2>Therapets as Helpful Companions</h2>
        <p>Therapets can be trained to do a multitude of tasks, much like service dogs. However, due to their intelligence and magic powers, they offer much more for their owners! From lifting things you can't reach to reminding you you still have to finish a task, there's all kinds of things a Therapet can help out with. Therapets get along with most any kind of race and species that will let them, and they often seek out others in need just to try and be of service (example: an injured <a target="_blank" href="http://puff-parade.deviantart.com/">Dreamie</a> that can't produce enough of it's own magic can benefit from a Therapet companion)</p>

        <h1>Breeding</h1>
        <p>When two Therapets fall in love, something amazing happens!</p>
        <p>In order for offspring to be made, two Therapets (of any gender) need to fall in love. Once this has happened, they will each go off to make a gift for the other; they each make a magical plush representing the children they wish to have together, and exchange them. Then, they use their magic sprinkle dust to create a nest for the plushies. They will stay in this nest for a short time, usually a few days, cuddling together with the plushies. While they do this, their fur/skin imbues the dolls with magic, and they come to life as little baby Therapets!</p>

        <h2>How to Breed Your Therapets</h2>
        <p>A few requirements must be met:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>They must have reaches Magical Maturity (Lore-wise, this means they have helped their Owner find a solution to a problem that'd been plaguing them (ex. managing depression, or finding a lost item that means a lot to them). For the group, this happens when your Therapet's approved app reaches 3 weeks old)</li>
          <li>There must be at least 3 Deviations showing the two Therapets bonding together (you can always draw them making the plushies for each other, or exchanging them, if you want!) These pictures must be full body, with a background and shading! The background must have depth and depict a place (no patterns/gradient BGs). For writing, it must be at least 1,200 words.</li>
          <li>Someone must buy a Magical Breeding Plush from the Magic Shop. Only one plush needs to be bought per breeding - this is you purchasing a breeding slot!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once those have all been met, fill out the form below and post it to this journal!</p>
        <p>Notes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All breedings result in 2 babies</li>
          <li>The babies will randomly receive traits from both parents, and the colors randomly from one parent</li>
          <li>If you do not want one of the babies, you can drop them off at the Adoption Center</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Wait, if this is based on 'True Love Magic', does that mean my Therapet will never be able to breed with a different Therapet?</h3>
        <p>No, not at all! Although rare, sometimes Therapets do 'fall out of love' and move on from one another. There's no hard feelings when this happens, though it is rare and is usually looked down upon.</p>
        <h3>How often can my Therapet Breed?</h3>
        <p>Once every 3 months, and each user can only own up to 3 bred Therapets.</p>

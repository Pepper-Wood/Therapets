        <h1>Rules and F.A.Q.</h1>
        <h2>General Rules</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Respect all members, period. If you have a disagreement with someone, be civil about it, and walk away if things get heated. If you have a problem with someone, PM an admin or Mod and they'll help you with it.</li>
          <li>Cursing <b>is</b> allowed, so long as it's not used to be rude to other members. Keep things that are in-character separate from out-of-character, and if someone asks you to not use a word around them, then try your best not to.</li>
          <li>No NSFW content is allowed! It does not fit the atmosphere of the group, so please take it elsewhere.</li>
          <li>Please, only once account per member. This helps to keep things tidy!</li>
          <li>Please do not block Moderators/Admins/Staff. If you have a problem with any of those people, contact someone else on the team and they will help you.</li>
          <li>The Mods, Admins, Staff, etc. are all volunteers. Please be patient with us!</li>
          <li>Anything submitted to the group must have something to do with this group! If you submit a journal or deviation, it must mention a Therapet somewhere - it can mention other characters, species, series, etc. as well, but it must have something to do with Therapets!</li>
          <li>Let us know if you change your username, so we know who you are still!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Therapets</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You may not sell/trade any Therapets characters/designs to someone outside of the group. Have them join, before you conduct business.</li>
          <li>You may not trade/sell any Therapets characters/designs for real-life currency, unless you bought it from the group for real-life currency (we don't want people buying designs for art, then selling it for money)</li>
          <li>Only submit art made by you! (If you used a base, put it in the correct folder and make sure to credit the base artist!)</li>
          <li>Before participating, you must get your Therapet design approved (see the <a target="_blank" href="http://therapets.deviantart.com/journal/Design-Approval-670321651">Approval Journal</a>)</li>
          <li>Be honest when counting your Sprinkles! If you are found cheating by purposely counting more than you earned, you will be warned. Persistent cases will be banned from the group.</li>

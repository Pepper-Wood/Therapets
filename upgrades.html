        <p>This is a list of every upgrade/modification you can buy for your Therapets! Make sure you have enough Sprinkles for it before you claim it!</p>

        <h2>Markings</h2>
        <p>Markings work a bit differently. Every time you want to add a different type of marking to your Therapet, you need to first buy a 'marking slot'. Each Therapet starts off with 1, and can have a maximum of 5. For example, you just made your Therapet, and during the tutorial added large areas of your accent color. You can add stripes without buying a marking slot, and that will technically be your first marking.</p>
